                <p class="message">Being kind to others charges no money. It is a unique characteristic of showing love
                    and caring for
                    others selflessly.We were taught to be kind, be modest to everyone, take up various
                    responsibilities, set our
                    priorities, and make decisions when we were kids.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on a Passion, Not the Way You Look</li>
                    <li>Work out to feel good, not be thinner.</li>
                    <li> Stop gossiping.
                        Spread positivity</li>
                    <li>Give one compliment a day.</li>
                    <li>Do Random Acts of Kindness</li>

            <h3 class="motivation"> At least once in your life, take the time to think about these questions. Before you
                know it, you will be old, or you may not even get that far. Your life can be over any minute. Are you
                satisfied with the way you live your life? Or do you regret some of the choices you made? Would you do
                things differently if you got a second chance? Do not hesitate any longer: discover the purpose of your
                life now.Here are some of my plans that i am determined to complete in this upcoming new year.
